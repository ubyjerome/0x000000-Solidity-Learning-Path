# My Solidity + Foundry Local Development Guide For My Solidity Learning/Development Path

# Solidity + Foundry Learning Notes

This repository documents my hands-on learning of Solidity smart contract development using Foundry.

## What I Covered
- Solidity fundamentals: contracts, state variables, functions, modifiers, structs, enums, mappings.
- Data locations: storage, memory, calldata.
- Function visibility and mutability.
- Events, errors, and require/revert patterns.
- Writing simple smart contracts (voting systems, basic logic contracts).
- Understanding how mappings and arrays work on-chain.
- Transactions vs read-only calls.
- Contract deployment and interaction.

## Foundry Workflow
- `forge init` for project setup.
- Writing contracts in `src/`.
- Writing tests in `test/`.
- Running tests with `forge test`.
- Deploying and interacting using Forge scripts.
- Broadcasting transactions with private keys and RPC URLs.
- Reading and understanding compiler and script errors.

## Tooling
- Foundry (forge, cast, anvil).
- Solidity.
- Ethers.js for contract interaction.
- Local development with Anvil.
